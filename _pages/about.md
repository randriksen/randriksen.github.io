Hi, I'm Ole, and I'm trying to find out if I'm as certifiable as I've claimed in the past. I'm currently working as a Chief Adviser for Microsoft technologies in RÃ¦lingen kommune, a municipality in Norway. More than a decade ago, I studied programming at the University of Oslo, but for the last 12 years, I've been working in IT operations in almost all aspects and capacities. I'm one of those people who care more about solving the problem than about how it's solved, and I'm always looking for ways to automate and simplify my work.

This blog is definitely a side project of mine, but in my non-spare time, I'm a father of three, a husband of one, and a nerd at heart. I love reading fantasy and sci-fi, and I play games of all kinds when I'm not busy with everything else.

## Things I've written in other places than this blog.  Here's a list of them:
