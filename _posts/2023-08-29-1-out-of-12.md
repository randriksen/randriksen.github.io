Quest update: 1 out of 12 done!
I passed the Microsoft 365 Certified: Fundamentals exam today with a score of 900/1000.
I'm pretty happy with that, since I gave myself a whole 3 days to prepare for it. And by days, I mean mostly nights, since I do have to work during the day, and I don't really have time to do much studying before the kids are in bed. 

Notes about this exam if you're planning to take it:
* It doesn't hurt to go through the learning paths on microsoft learn, it covers the basics pretty well.
* Read up on the products that you're not very familiar with. For me that was Viva, Planner, Booking and most of the things dealing with azure information protection.
* Learn the difference between the different licenses. Knowing when to use F1 vs E5 is important.
* If you've worked in the field for a while, trust your knowledge. A lot of this exam is common sense.

Now, onto the next one. I have to recertify for my AWS certifications before December 4th, so it might be that one.
