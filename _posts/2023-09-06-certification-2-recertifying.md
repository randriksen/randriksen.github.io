I just recieved an email from AWS that I need to recertify, or my AWS certifications will expire on December 4th.
So I guess that's a sign from the universe that I should do that one next. 

Last time I took the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional exam, it was pretty tough. But from what i remember, it was really mostly about learning which products to use in which situations, and how they compare in the pricing models. I don't remember the specifics, but there were questions where you had to choose between 2-5 products, and you had to know which one was the cheapest, or which one was the most scalable, or which one was the most secure.

I haven't worked much with AWS since I changed jobs last year, so I'll have to give myself a crash course.  Since I'm not planning on paying for classes, I'll probably starty by going through the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/) page, and read up on the different products and services.  I'll probably also be checking out the [skill builder](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn).

Other than that we'll see. I'm aiming to take this exam around September 20th, so I'm giving myself about 15 days to read for it.
