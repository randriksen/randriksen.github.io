For my next trick, I'll be pursuing the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/) certification.
certification. I feel that's the logical next choice since I'm actually aiming to earn the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/) certification.

To prepare for this, I plan to swiftly go through all the AZ-104 Learning paths on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-104/)
of which there are 6, with a total of 51 modules! 
![learning paths](/assets/images/certification3/learningpaths.png) I'm not sure how fast this will go, but I want to take the exam sometime in October. 
I'm working more and more with Azure lately, so this should be quite usefull.

I'll be back when there's more to report about the quest progress.
