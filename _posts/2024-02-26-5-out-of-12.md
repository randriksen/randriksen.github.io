So, it's been a while since I last wrote about my quest. For various reasons, I've fallen a bit behind schedule. I didn't earn any new certifications in either December or January. With the end of February now rapidly approaching, I decided it was high time to resume my efforts.

I considered taking the [SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/sc-900/) exam. However, the fundamentals exams are usually quite straightforward, so I plan to avoid relying on them too much in this quest. This doesn't mean I won't take them, but I'll aim for the more challenging ones.

Instead, I set my sights on the [SC-300: Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/sc-300/) exam. Given my many years of experience with Identities and Access, I believed this exam would not pose too much of a challenge. So, last Thursday, just before 22:00, after passing the assessment for the exam on Learn just once, I scheduled an exam for the following morning, Friday, 23.02 at 10:00.

## How did I prepare for this exam?
I'm almost tempted to say I didn't. But that wouldn't be entirely accurate. As I mentioned, I've worked with Identities and Access for most of my career, so in a way, I've been preparing for this exam for the last 15 years. I didn't take any of the courses for it on Learn, nor did I watch any YouTube videos this time. I did the assessment a few more times after scheduling the exam, but that was the extent of it.

## My thoughts about the exam
This exam turned out to be somewhat challenging. Since I hadn't really prepared in the conventional sense, I was quite convinced I had failed by the end of it. I was also surprised to encounter a lab exercise in a Microsoft exam for the first time. The lab was similar to those found in skills assessments, which, fortunately, I had some experience with, so I knew how to navigate it. My primary advice for anyone pursuing certifications is to have some experience with skills assessments beforehand.

I used all the allotted time for the exam. In the past, I usually had plenty of time left over, but this exam was different for me. I even ran out of time for one of the lab exercises.

I was also surprised that I didn't receive the results immediately after finishing the test. For a while, I was just waiting.

But then, I suddenly received the email: I had passed!

So, I'm at least back on track with taking certifications. I'm two certifications behind schedule, but I'm determined to work even harder to catch up.

I'm considering going for the [SC-100: Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/sc-100/) next.
