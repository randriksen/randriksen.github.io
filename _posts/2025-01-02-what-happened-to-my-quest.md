It's been a while since I wrote anything in this blog, so I should probably explain why.  

For the first part of last year, I felt like there was a cloud over my head.  
I knew my job in municipal IT was going to disappear—or at least change significantly. The municipality decided to outsource IT to a bigger MSP. While I could have automatically transferred to a position there, my gut told me I wouldn't be happy. So, I started looking for other opportunities.  

I interviewed with several companies, and while some didn’t fit me, others decided I wasn’t the right fit for them. Finally, in June, I accepted an offer from [Lillestrøm Kommune](https://lillestrom.kommune.no) for a super cool and challenging position: solutions architect.

This role is quite different from what I’ve done before. For the first time in years, I’m not responsible for the day-to-day operations of IT systems. I’m no longer the Global Admin of the Microsoft 365 tenant I work with—a bit of a relief but also an adjustment. I’ve had to get used to not having the power to fix things myself.  
Instead, my focus has shifted to solving bigger-picture problems: understanding how things are, envisioning how they should be, and creating a roadmap to get there.  

My work ties directly into "Teknologiløftet" (The Technology Lift), a major program aimed at modernizing healthcare services in the municipality. The idea is simple but crucial: as the need for healthcare grows, the workforce won’t scale proportionally. To meet this challenge, we’re going to have to use technology to make services more efficient and accessible without compromising quality. It's exciting but also quite different from what I’m used to.  

## What About My Quest for Certifications?  

With the new job, I’ve had to sideline my certification goals for a bit.  
This role requires me to focus on a different set of skills, and technical certifications aren’t always the best way to get there. While several of the certifications I’ve done remain relevant, I’m prioritizing what I need to learn for this role.  

I’ve started exploring TOGAF, which seems like a good next step, though I haven’t decided when I’ll tackle it. In the meantime, I’ve taken a few skills assessments on Microsoft Learn—great for quick breaks and targeted learning.  

If you’re curious, my [Quest status page](https://www.randriksen.net/queststatus) is up-to-date, showing what I’ve completed so far.  

As of early 2025, I’m still on the quest, though it’s running on overtime.  
Between August 2023 and August 2024, I managed 7 certifications, 2 renewals, 4 skills assessments, and a few cases on Kusto Detective Agency. Not quite 12 certifications, but a solid effort nonetheless.
