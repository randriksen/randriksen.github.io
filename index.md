I have recently decided that I need to test something that I've claimed at job interviews:
That my superpower is that i can pass almost any certification exam with just a few weeks of studying.
Therefore my insane quest right now is going be:  
**Try to pass 12 exams in the next 12 months!**

I will probably write about my other projects as well.

For fun and learning, I'm doing this with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
