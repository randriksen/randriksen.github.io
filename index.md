Working on my new blog
=======================

I'm working on my new blog where I will write about my insane quest to take 12 certifications in 12 months, and about my other projects and things i find interiesting, annoying or both.

For fun and learning, I'm doing this with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, and I'm using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.
