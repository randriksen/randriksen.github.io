I have recently decided that I need to test something that I've claimed at job interviews:
That my superpower is that i can pass almost any certification exam with just a few weeks of studying.
Therefore my insane quest right now is going be: **Try to pass 12 exams in the next 12 months!**

I might write about my other projects, or just things I find interesting, annoying or both.

For fun and learning, I'm doing this with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
